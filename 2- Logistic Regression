Logistic regression is a statistical model used for binary classification problems, where the goal is to predict the probability of an event belonging to one of two classes. Despite its name, logistic regression is a classification algorithm, not a regression algorithm.

In logistic regression, the dependent variable is a binary variable that represents the presence or absence of a certain event or class. The independent variables are predictor variables that can be continuous or categorical.

The logistic regression model applies a logistic function (also known as the sigmoid function) to a linear combination of the independent variables. The logistic function maps the linear combination to a value between 0 and 1, representing the probability of the event belonging to the positive class.

The logistic regression equation can be represented as:

p = 1 / (1 + e^(-z))

Where:

    p is the probability of the event belonging to the positive class.
    z is the linear combination of the independent variables and their respective coefficients.

The linear combination (z) is calculated as:

z = β₀ + β₁x₁ + β₂x₂ + ... + βₙxₙ

Where:

    x₁, x₂, ..., xₙ are the independent variables.
    β₀, β₁, β₂, ..., βₙ are the coefficients of the logistic regression model.

During the training process, logistic regression estimates the coefficients (β₀, β₁, β₂, ..., βₙ) that best fit the training data, maximizing the likelihood of the observed data.

To make predictions using a trained logistic regression model, the probability output by the model is typically compared to a threshold (e.g., 0.5). If the predicted probability is above the threshold, the sample is classified as the positive class; otherwise, it is classified as the negative class.

Logistic regression is widely used in various domains, including healthcare, finance, marketing, and social sciences. It is known for its interpretability, probabilistic output, and simplicity. However, it assumes a linear relationship between the independent variables and the log-odds of the event, which may not always hold in complex datasets.
